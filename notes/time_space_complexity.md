# Time and Space complexity :tada: :rocket:

## Time complexity
Time complexity of an algorithm is basically the growth in runtime of the algorithm with respect to its input , like what happens to the algorithm when the input of the algorithm grows , how time behaves.

We measure the time complexity of an algorithm by the number of operations the algorithm took.

## Space complexity
Space complexity of an algorithms tells us about the growth in space of the algorithm with respect to its input.
