# Stack :tada: :rocket:
Stack is a LIFO data structure ( Last in first out) , basically the item appended/added in the last will be the item to be out first.

ADT - ( Abstract data type ) , some people call stack as an ADT instead of data structure.

Three basic methods that a stack always proviedes
- PUSH
- POP
- PEEK

all the operations in a stack will take O(1) time , eg PUSH, POP and PEEK, the stacks can be implemented using `Arrays` and `LinkedList`
